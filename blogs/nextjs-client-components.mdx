After you complete this article, you will have a solid understanding of:

- **Where client components are actually rendered.**
- **Why client components aren't just rendered on the client, and what the benefits are.**
- **What hydration is, what a hydration error is, and how to fix one.**

There are two types of components in Next.js

1. **Server Components**
2. **Client Components**

Server components are relatively easy to understand (okay, maybe not). They are rendered only on the server and sent to the client as a static HTML file.

_But what happens with client components? Do they only render on the client?
Why do we even need client components? How are they useful?_

I know you have many questions in your mind, but let's take it step by step.

## Have You Ever Encountered a Hydration Error?

If you're lucky and have never seen one, let's take a look at what a hydration error looks like. This error will actually help you understand some concepts even more clearly.

Try running this code in your editor:

```jsx
"use client";
const MyComponent = () => {
  const currentTime = new Date().getTime();
  return <div>{currentTime}</div>;
};
```

And, you will see;

**"Server-rendered HTML didn't match the client."**

<Alert type="error">
  Wait, what? Why was the HTML rendered on the server even though it was a
  client component? Isn't it supposed to be rendered on the client? How is this
  different from server components if everything is rendered on the server?
</Alert>

Let's start by understanding what hydration actually is.

### What is Hydration?

Hydration → The process of taking pre-rendered HTML (usually generated on the
server) and enhancing it with client-side JavaScript to enable interactivity.

So, hydration gives our HTML a superpower. Thanks to the hydration process, we're not just reading a plain HTML document coming from the server, but we're also able to interact with it.

When we create a client component in Next.js, first, a **pre-rendered HTML** is created for that component on the **server side**—but nothing else.

No JavaScript code, no React `useState` calls, no `useEffect` calls. It's just the HTML code.

After we receive that HTML on the client side, we are ready to start the hydration process. At this point, we get our `useState` calls, `useEffect`, or any other interactivity used in our component.

_Okay. But can we render everything on the client? I don't want to get involved with hydration or any other stuff!_

Of course, we can. But there are downsides.

## Benefits of Server-Side Rendering Before Hydration

1. Faster Initial Load

If all Client Components ran only on the client, you would see a blank screen while waiting for JavaScript to load and execute.

2. Better SEO

A fully client-rendered page can cause SEO issues, as search engines may struggle to index content properly.

3. Network Optimization

Server-rendered HTML has a smaller bundle size and better caching opportunities at the CDN level.

Now we know why rendering the HTML part on the server and sending the JavaScript code afterward (a.k.a hydration) is a better approach in most cases.

## Understanding Hydration Errors

Let's go back to the hydration error we encountered earlier. What exactly is causing the hydration error?

React compares the **server-rendered HTML** with the **Virtual DOM** it creates on the client side during hydration.

If something changes between these two steps, you'll get an error. Remember what it said:
_"Server-rendered HTML didn't match the client."_

### Common Causes of Hydration Errors

```jsx
"use client";
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <p>
      <div></div>
    </p>
  );
};
```

In a case like this, the browser might try to fix the incorrectly placed elements. If that happens, the final HTML won't match React's Virtual DOM, leading to a hydration error.

Another common cause is trying to access the `window` object inside a client component. Since `window` doesn't exist on the server, it causes hydration issues.

## Opting Out of Server-Side Rendering

_What if we want to render a component **only** on the client? Is there a way to do that?_

There is always a way for everything!

```jsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const MyComponent = dynamic(() => import("../components/MyComponent"), {
  ssr: false,
});

export default function Page() {
  return <MyComponent />;
}
```

This way, `MyComponent` will **only** render on the client, and Next.js won't attempt to pre-render it on the server.

Now you fully understand how Client Components work in Next.js!
